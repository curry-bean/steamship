"""A Steamship package for prompt-based text generation.

This package provides a simple template for building prompt-based applications.

To run it:
1. Get a Steamship API Key (Visit: https://steamship.com/account/api). If you do not
   already have a Steamship account, you will need to create one.
2. Copy this key to a Replit Secret named STEAMSHIP_API_KEY.
3. Click the green `Run` button at the top of the window (or open a Shell and type `python3 api.py`).

More information about this template is provided in README.md.

To learn more about advanced uses of Steamship, read our docs at: https://docs.steamship.com/packages/using.html.
